# Automatic polyp detection 
###Automatic polyp detection by using transfer learning with fine tuning DCNNs and data augmentation for colonoscopy images
-----


Polyps are known as possible colorectal cancer precursors, and its early detection is very important, but highly challenging from an image processing standpoint. Current trends in the research have demonstrated that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are very effective in automatically analyzing images. However, the requirement of large number of annotated samples prohibits its widely using in medical image analyzing, since collecting and labelling a large amount of data from the medical domain is difficult to obtain, therefore, training DCNNs from scratch to polyp detection is unrealistic due to limited training dataset. Our study overcomes this challenge by using transfer learning (TL) methods and data augmentation. We utilize a pre-trained DCNNs, which is pre-trained on a large collection of natural ImageNet images. We transfer the learned ImageNet weights as initial weights, and then fine-tune the pre-trained model combined with a new deep classifier called fully connected network (FCN) with data augmentation of colposcopy images to automatically detect polyps. In case of insufficient colonoscopy images, data augmentation and deep features extracted using TL strategy can provide sufficient classification information. We conducted experiments on CVC-ColonDB data sets with this framework, tests show that our deep features combined with the FCN can provide suitable information to out-perform previous state-of-the-art methods with minimum pre-processing procedures and a significantly higher accuracy (above 95.1%).![Training Figure](tl_resnet50.png)
